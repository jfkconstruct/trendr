# Performance Optimization Plan

## Current State Analysis

Looking at the existing implementation in `/app/api/discover/route.ts`, several areas can benefit from performance improvements:

### API Response Times
- YouTube API calls involve multiple requests (search + details)
- Instagram and TikTok API calls may have rate limiting concerns
- Database upsert operations could be optimized

### Database Queries
- The current implementation performs upsert operations for each discovered item
- Could benefit from batch operations where possible
- Indexing on platform and viral_score columns would improve query performance

### Resource Usage
- Image loading for thumbnails could be optimized
- Redundant API calls should be minimized
- Caching strategies could be implemented for frequent lookups

## Optimization Strategies

### 1. API Call Optimization
- Implement request batching for YouTube API calls
- Add caching for Instagram and TikTok API responses
- Implement connection pooling for database operations

### 2. Database Operations
- Replace individual upserts with batch operations where possible
- Add proper indexing to content_references table
- Implement pagination for large result sets

### 3. Caching Strategy
- Cache recently discovered content for a short period
- Cache API responses from external services
- Implement CDN for thumbnail images

### 4. Code-Level Optimizations
- Reduce unnecessary data processing
- Implement lazy loading for non-critical UI elements
- Optimize data structures for faster access

## Implementation Approach

### Phase 1: Immediate Improvements (Week 1)
- Add database indexing for performance
- Implement basic caching for API responses
- Optimize YouTube API calls

### Phase 2: Medium-Term Improvements (Week 2-3)
- Batch database operations
- Implement connection pooling
- Add CDN support for thumbnails

### Phase 3: Advanced Optimizations (Week 4+)
- Implement sophisticated caching strategies
- Add request queuing for rate-limited APIs
- Add performance monitoring and logging

## Monitoring Metrics

- API response time (target: < 2 seconds)
- Database query time (target: < 500ms)
- Memory usage (target: < 500MB)
- Concurrent request handling capability
